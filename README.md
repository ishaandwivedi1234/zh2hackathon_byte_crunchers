# Split Monk | A Bill Splitter Application | Zeta Hacks 
Split Monk is A Bill Splitter Solution that involves following steps to create your groups and events - :

● A group is made on the bill splitter application and people can join the group using group code . For better understanding let’s say a group of
college friends .

● Now, whenever any event is completed (let’s take pizza party as our event) and bills are paid then any one member of the group can create an event on app mentioning the total amount, and how much amount is paid by each individual .

● With the event being created, the application smartly calculates and distributes the total amount according to how much each of them paid , and shows detailed report of who should pay to whom and how much, in-order to equally distribute the total amount.
 
● Also, the application provides pay feature, so that after the report is generated they can transfer the money using UPI in just one click .
